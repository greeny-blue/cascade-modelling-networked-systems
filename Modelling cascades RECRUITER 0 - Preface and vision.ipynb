    "From a cybersecurity perspective, many of the most serious failures are not caused by a single exploit but by cascading effects across interconnected systems — misconfigurations, partial outages, defensive interventions or unexpected interactions between components. This project is a deliberate attempt to build intuition for how such cascades emerge, propagate and sometimes amplify, using simplified network models.\n",

    "This notebook series is an exploration and a learning/experimental record of these concepts using **simple models and simulations** built from first principles. It is **not** intended for prediction or optimisation, nor is it an exact representation of real networks. Instead, it is to develop defensive intuition about network fragility, resilience, and second-order effects — the kinds of reasoning needed in real environments where network security is a top priority.
